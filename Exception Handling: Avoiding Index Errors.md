# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
try:
   print(list1[7])
   print("Index access succeeded")
except Exception:
   print("You're out of list range")
```

## Result
Thus,to write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list is executed successfully.
