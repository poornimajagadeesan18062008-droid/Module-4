## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a={1:"a",2:"b",3:"c"}
b={2:"d",3:"e"}
def merge(a,b):
   print({**a,**b})
merge(a,b)
```

## Result
Thus,to write a Python program that merges two dictionaries and combines their key-value pairs is executed successfully.
